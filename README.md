The project is a smart medical care system applied in a hospital by using gPRC architecture to implement it. In this modern hospital, we focus on the needs of three groups of roles, they are patients, doctors, and nurses. Moreover, the application functions aim to achieve patient satisfaction, improve operational efficiency, and optimise the clinical process of care.
Based on the demands, the project design includes three essential services to build the smart hospital. The first one is the smart appointment, which has methods to allow patients to make an appointment anytime, anywhere with their own devices. The second service is Real-time monitoring, applying methods to help nurses improve efficiency in taking care of multiple patients. The third one is intelligent archiving, which adopts methods making patient filing more accurate and more convenient to read the specific information to doctors and nurses.
Here are two methods in each service, total six. The methods cover four RPC type, which are Unary, Client Streaming, Server Streaming, and Bidirectional Streaming.
